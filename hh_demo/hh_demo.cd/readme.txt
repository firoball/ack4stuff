The Conflict - Final Version

Released 7/29/01

Ok, I'm back from Dusmania 2k1 and we all made it back home.
I just switched on my PC and fixed some minor glitches.
Well I can't see this demo anymore, so just enjoy it as it
is right now.
I was too lazy to create a starter for resolution changing,
so have fun with some old fashioned Batch-Editing ;)

Here's a list of available commandline parameters:

-wnd
	windowed mode (not recommended)

-w3d
	starts weak 3d mode for older graphic cards

-crd x
	selects a secondary 3d device. x ranges from 1 to 3
	you'll have to try out to find the correct number.
	It varies from system to system

-d HICOLOR
	run demo in 32 Bit mode (16 bit is default)
	Software Mode (8Bit) is not supported.

-d VIDEO1
	run demo at 320x200

-d VIDEO2
	run demo at 320x240

-d VIDEO3
	run demo at 320x400

-d VIDEO4
	run demo at 400x300

-d VIDEO5
	run demo at 512x384

-d VIDEO6
	run demo at 640x480

-d VIDEO7
	run demo at 800x600

-d VIDEO8
	run demo at 1024x768

-d VIDEO9
	run demo at 1280x960

-d VIDEO10
	run demo at 1600x1200


System Requirements:

Nothing great, a P200MMX with Voodoo2, 96MB Ram and
DirectX compatible Soundcard is just fine.
This demo probably runs on slower systems as well,
but my PC was the slowest one available at 
Dusmania :P

Ok, have fun.

PS: Greetz and all that stuff are in the demo.
I'm too lazy to write it all here again ;)
