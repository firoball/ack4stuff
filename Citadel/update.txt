modified: movement.wdl, citadel.wdl, forest.wmp, forest1.wmp (see remarks)

-improved camera behavior
-added moving up down of camera (looks better when player is not moving)
        still causes some trembling of the model but that will go away
        when model has waiting animation
-added timer function for up/down move of camera
-rebuilt forest level. now clipepd terrain is supported
        still looks ugly because terrain is not yet optimized
        skydome is missing, this leads to display bugs
        terrain tiles should be smaller
        to speed up things enter CLIP_RANGE=1500 into commandline
        also try out fog_color=1
        speed is good on my P200MMX. I get 30-45 frames in 640x480 with voodoo2
        software mode is slow though. ~16fps in 320x240

Next step:      optimizing terrain and searching a good way to preserve speed
                implementing reversed alpha blobs for d3d mode and simple
                transparent blob shadows for software mode

Verified Bugs:  Due to an engine bug polygonal shadows don't work on flat surfaces
                Don't work on shaded map entities either... this means blob shadows
                for now
Fixed Bugs:     Fixed some time correction issues with camera movement

modified:	movement.wdl, citadel.wdl, forest.wmp, forest1.wmp, tree1.wmp
		nahhh... nearly everything. 	

-added sky dome with test skin
-changed clip range and fog_color defaults
-uploaded published test. (files/citadel.zip)

Next step: see last update (...)

Verified Bugs:  fog is making me mad. can't get the terrain and tree entities to
		fog independently from the skydome in d3d mode.
		in software mode it worked. weird.
		For now sky is fogged too. but on my system it's too dark, on
		my brother's system the clipping is still visible.
		We need smaller trees.

Fixed bugs:	display bugs fixed because of skydome.
